ch559 source code samples translated into english

note that where a file was translated I kept a copy of the original in the same folder but with a suffix of "original".

translations are done manually by putting them through Google translate - I don't know if the Google translator has mangled the code in some way but hopefully not.  Even if it has, it's useful to be able to read the comments.
